# Mars-Data-Challenge
Module 11 Challenge

Using BeautifulSoup to scrape Mars data from a website, I was able to gather info on the temperatures and atmospheric pressure during the Martian year. After extracting the data, I used Matplotlib to show the results by plotting bar charts. The visualizations clearly show the comparison of hottest and coldest months, as well as the pressure variations during the year.

Resources
In creating the code, some resources were employed, including:
- ChatGPT was used for help with the 'find_all' command, as well as when to add 'text' to a line of code.
- ChatGPT was also used to help change the data types after creating the DataFrame
